#Baby Feeding Schedule

##Why?
My son was born in Nov, 2015. I guess this is the best program I've ever made.
We read some books and decided to track everything as they suggest.
After 2 weeks, I was facing a notebook full of unreadable data; and my wife nearly gave up.
My wife said, 'let there be an all-in-one feeding table', and that's it.
